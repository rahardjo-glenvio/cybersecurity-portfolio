## Learning Approach

Each lab provides:
- Detailed setup and configuration instructions
- Step-by-step exploitation methodology
- Defensive mitigation techniques
- Real-world security scenarios
- Professional documentation

## Environment Requirements

All laboratories are designed for:
- Isolated virtual machine environments
- Network segmentation from production systems
- Proper authorization and ethical guidelines
- Educational and research purposes only

## Lab Structure

Each lab directory contains:
- README with objectives and prerequisites
- Configuration files and setup scripts
- Exploitation tools and payloads
- Mitigation strategies and secure implementations
- Technical reports and documentation

## Safety Notice

These labs contain intentional vulnerabilities and should only be deployed in isolated, controlled environments. Never use these techniques on systems without explicit authorization.
